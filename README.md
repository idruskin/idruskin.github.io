I am a fourth year in the Khoury College of Computer Science at Northeastern University pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Behavioral Neuroscience. As I have developed a deeper understanding of programming and human computer interaction, I have discovered how I could use this knowledge to help those around me in unconventional ways. 

I am extremely passionate about team collaboration to solve complex problems and have no problem to fulfill leadership roles. Through my projects, previous job experiences, and coursework, I have demonstrated significant skills in data analytics, time management, pet therapy, and web development. Many of my skills I have learned outside the classroom to be able to pursue my passions revolving around a technical, behavioral field. My experience to pick up skills quickly, attention to details, and strong collaboration skills will allow me to be successful in my career.

Please feel free to go through my various projects that I have worked on over the course of 4 years revolving around web development, reinforce search algorithms, multi-agent search, and reinforcement learning.
