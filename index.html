 <h1 style="text-indent:15px; color: white"> About </h1>
<h4 style="font-family: Playfair Display; color: white; margin-left: 15px">
I am a rising fourth year in the Khoury College of Computer Science at Northeastern University pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Behavioral Neuroscience. 
As I have developed a deeper understanding of programming and human computer interaction, I have discovered how I could use this knowledge to help those around me in unconventional ways. 
I am extremely passionate about team collaboration to solve complex problems and I also enjoy having leadership roles.

Through my projects, previous job experiences, and coursework, I have demonstrated significant skills in data analytics, time management, pet therapy and web development. Many of my skills have been developed outside the classroom allowing me to pursue my passions revolving around a technical, behavioral field. My experience to pick up skills quickly, attention to details, and strong collaboration skills will allow me to be successful in my career. </h4>
