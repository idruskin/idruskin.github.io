 <h1> I am a fourth year in the Khoury College of Computer Science at Northeastern University pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Behavioral Neuroscience. As I have developed a deeper understanding of programming and human computer interaction, I have discovered how I could use this knowledge to help those around me in unconventional ways. I am extremely passionate about team collaboration to solve complex problems and have no problem to fulfill leadership roles. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
Through my projects, previous job experiences, and coursework, I have demonstrated significant skills in data analytics, time management, pet therapy, and web development. Many of my skills I have learned outside the classroom to be able to pursue my passions revolving around a technical, behavioral field. My experience to pick up skills quickly, attention to details, and strong collaboration skills will allow me to be successful in my career.  </h1>
